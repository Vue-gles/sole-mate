# sole-mate

Overview:
“Ever want to run but can't do it alone? SoleMate is an app made to find a running buddy near you.“

MVP:
SoleMate optimizes the way runners find other runners with similar fitness levels and goals. Users are able to set their availability (now or later), view other runners interested in a similar time frame and location, and request to schedule a run. Once a run is confirmed, SoleMates are able to message each other to finalize logistics.

Stretch Goals:

- Use a map API to add markers and routes on maps to help plan out a run with your new friend.
- Cancel scheduled runs (without hurting each others feelings).
- Questionnaire with weights that is used to calculate matching percentages with other runners
- OAuth with fitbit, apple watch, and facebook
- Individualized goal tracking
- More in depth user profiles

Tech Stack:

- ReactNative
- Map API (GoogleMaps vs Mapbox)
- Sequelize / PostgresSQL
- NERD stack
- Basic CSS/CSS library
