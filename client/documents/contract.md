At 5:00pm make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master.

Team expectations
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought.
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally).
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code.
Constantly ask for clarification.
Constantly communicate through Slack and GitProjects what you are working on (especially if there are any changes to your task, especially during weekends).
If you finish tasks early, discuss with group what you should work on next
Over communicating is better
** For thanksgiving we agree that working during break is ok, we will discuss specifics at a later time.
Create a queue of tasks to work on during weekends and Thanksgiving Break.
